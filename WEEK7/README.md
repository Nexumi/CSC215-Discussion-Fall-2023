> Week 7 Practice Problems<br>[Topic: Arrays]

<hr>

- Problem 1: Create a method that takes a 2D array of characters, and prints them out in a grid pattern.
    - Output must match the sample output (spaces between each symbol and a new line for each row)

```java
char[][] symbols = {
    {'!', '@', '#'},
    {'$', '%', '^'},
    {'&', '*', '(', ')'}
}
```
```
! @ #
$ % ^
& * ( )
```
