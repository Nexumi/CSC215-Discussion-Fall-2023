<hr>

- Problem 1: Create a method that repeatedly asks the user for an integer, then output the day of the week that number is. 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, etc. End when the user inputs an invalid day of the week.
	- Write 2 methods, one using if/else if/else statements, and another using switch/case statements.
	- If the user inputs something other than 0-7, display something like "Invalid day of the week"

```
Enter a day of the week (0 - 6): 3
3 is Wednesday
Enter a day of the week (0 - 6): 6
6 is Saturday
Enter a day of the week (0 - 7): 15
15 is an invalid day of the week
```

- Problem 2: Create a method that repeatedly asks the user for an integer until either 10 numbers are entered or a negative number is entered. Sum up all the numbers entered by the user, excluding the negative number.
	- Write 3 versions, using a different type of loop each time.
		- Loops: While | Do-While | For
